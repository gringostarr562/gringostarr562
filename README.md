- 👋 Hi, I’m @gringostarr562. I'm a maker and MechE. I am NOT a coder, just out here doing my best. 
- 👀 I’m interested in: robotics, (light) home automation, and game design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: wtf GotHub even is.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: solving my inevitable numerous mistakes.
- 📫 How to reach me: Again, not sure why you'd want to. 
- 😄 Pronouns: sau / sage
- ⚡ Fun fact: My day job is building satellites. I even got to touch the JWST

Current project backlog (in no particular order)
    - Raspberry Pi front door cam with package delivery/visitor notification (knock,knock muthafucka)
    
    - Air quality monitor (meybe breathe less today?)
    
    - Raspberry Pi-controlled indoor hydroponic garden (vegitables, but harder)
    
    - Home-made Space Mouse ripoff (get dizzy, idior)
    
    - Custom ergo mouse (the middle age.. it's closing in)
    - Custom game controller argo handles (gol ram tiny controllers make my hands tired)
    - Fancy adjustable desk lamp (is there not something reasonably priced AND also not an ugly pile of crap?)
    - Home theatre system with flat panel speakers and laser-connected surround sound (living like the richest asshole in 1999)
    - Fidget toy (i got the stimming, Paw)
    - A robot for diggin holes (i give you: sitting on my ass. you give me: dirt, but with a bonus dispproving stare from my wife)
    - Gandalf Big Naturals (i refuse to explain further)
